## A BOOK REGISTER  APPLICATION (MEAN STACK IMPLEMENTATION) IN AWS
A technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. 
This set of frameworks and tools are very specifically chosen to work together in creating a well-designed software. 
I used Anguular framwork to create the frontend while using Expressjs to create the backend. 
I equally used the Node.js to create the java runtime script end of the appliocation
I stored the data captured by the GUI in the MongoDB account that i created
As can be seen in the application displayit can be seen that it captuires records and store in Mongodb
